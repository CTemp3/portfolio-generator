# portfolio-generator

Hello! This is my portfolio generator program that I'm writing as part of module 9 for the University of Utah coding bootcamp. The purpose of this project is to learn how to properly utilise node.js.

This program, when complete, will be able to take in a set of data and output a functional portfolio, displaying websites you've built and offering a quick and easy solution to building a portfolio.
